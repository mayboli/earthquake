The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides earthquake data that is updated every 5 minutes separated into categories such as different magnitudes from the past hour, past day, past 7 days, and past 30 days. 

I have selected all earthquakes from the previous 7 days and using the JSON returned from USGS, I have plotted out the data points on Leaflet. The Leaflet map I have made of the earthquakes have circle markers varying in size and color depending on the magnitude, which is described in the legend. 

After analzying the map, it seems that most of the earthquakes in the United States are on the west coast, with most of them on all edges of California. 

Then, zooming out from the map, it appears that the earthquakes with higher magnitudes actually appear elsewhere in the world, such as the coast of South America and tons of huge earthquakes on land bordering the Pacific Ocean. 

With some research on Google, it is discovered that the tectonic plates occur along the west coast of United States and South America which explains why most of the earthquakes occur there. The earthquakes that occur in the Pacific Ocean is actually called the "Ring of Fire".
